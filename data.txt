# Path Forwad:
-- Python Installation
-- VSCode Installation
-- Create Virual Environment for Isolation  [python -m venv venv]
-- Activate venv [venv\Scripts\activate] or In above search bar write .\Scripts\activate
-- Install FastAPI as well as all dependencies require to use fastapi [pip install fastapi[all]]
-- Run Server [uvicorn main:app --reload]
-- When we have different function but method is same and path is same then fastapi retreive data or do any operations based on first match...
-- GET: Fteach Data from DB, POST: To Provide data to backend or DB
-- CRUD Operations: Create(POST), Read (GET), Update(PUT(we have to provide all the details)/PATCH(we have to provide speocific details that we have to change)), Delete(DELETE)
-- Path Operations Order Matter in Fatseapi because if some one having function with path opt get('/post/{id}')  and get('/post/latest') so this both are different so when ever you execute next function it give error becuase latest validate with id which is not true
-- Maintain the Status Code like 404 Not Found, 201 When Data Posted or Created so and soooo
-- Support Automatic Serialization...
-- Limitation of FastAPI: Database Migration so there for we have to use alembic library...
-- Using Pydantic Model we can return what data we want full data or specific data...
-- For Authorization we have to use JWT Variable for Automatic Environment Authorization.
